On linux, the standard library will be installed in /lib/quartz and any additional libraries will be installed
in /usr/lib/quartz. 

If you want a library installed just for a project, then as long as the path that the 
compiler is running in detects a /lib/quartz folder with the desired libraries, it will use it. You can also
use the "-l" flag to point it to a directory with the libraries you want to use.
