In quartz all arrays are made resizable by default. 

If you want a fixed size array, then use this syntax:

```
int[] fixedArray;
fixedArray.sizeLock(8);
```

There is a shorthand syntax to tell the compiler
to do this for you.

```
int[8] fixedArray;
```

If you want a raw data array, then use this syntax:

```
int* rawArray = new int[8];
```

with this syntax you can also set a default value
using a constructor like so:

```
int* rawArray = new int(0)[8];
```
